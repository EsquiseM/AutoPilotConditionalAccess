# Tutorial: Easy configuration using Conditional Access API Templates

Planning your Conditional Access deployment is critical to achieving your organization's access strategy for apps and resources.

Conditional Access policies are if-then statements: If an assignment is met, then apply these access controls.

When configuring Conditional Access policies, conditions are called assignments. Conditional Access policies allow you to enforce access controls on your organizationâ€™s apps based on certain assignments.

For more information, see [Components of CA policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policies).

You can use the conditional access APIs to manage policies at scale. For example, you can:

- Get a snapshhot of all conditional access policies within your organization and take backups.
- Update a conditional access policy to add new groups as you rollout your policies within your organization.
- Update the list of applications you are targeting within the conditional access policies as new line of business application are added in your organization.
- Delete a policy that is no longer needed.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

# Step 1: Authenticate with the right roles

If you are using delegated permissions flow, sign in using an account with one of these roles:

For read and write to conditional access policies:

- Global administrator
- [Conditional Access administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#conditional-access-administrator-permissions) ***Recommended***
- Security administrator

For reading conditional access policies:

- [Security Reader permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#security-reader-permissions)
- [Global Reader permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#global-reader-permissions)

# Step 2: Authenticate with the right permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call the read API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type                        | Permissions (all three roles below are required for read and write operations)                    |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | Policy.Read.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application                            | Policy.Read.All |

All of the below three permissions are required to call the read and write API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type                        | Permissions (all three roles below are required for read and write operations)                    |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | Policy.Read.All, Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess and Application.Read.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application                            | Policy.Read.All, Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess and Application.Read.All |

# Step 3: Connect to Azure AD PowerShell module

Connect to the General Availability release of Azure Active Directory V2 PowerShell Module. A minimum version of [2.0.2.106](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureAD/2.0.2.106) is required. 

To install version '2.0.2.106', run Install-Module and add the -Force parameter, this command will install version '2.0.2.106' side-by-side with previous version.

```
Install-Module -Name AzureAD -Force
```
Once completed, connect to Azure AD.

```
Connect-AzureAD
```

To get help with Conditional Access policy cmdlets use the following Get-help command.

```
Get-help AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy
```

# Step 3: Create a Conditional Access Policy 

The steps to create a Sign-in risk-based Conditional Access policy [create sign-in risk policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk) within Azure Portal is documented. Let us use this document as a reference to create a policy called "CA002: Require MFA for medium + sign-in risk" using the APIs.

To get help with New Conditional Access policy creation cmdlets, use the following *Get-help* command.

```
Get-help New-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy
```

To create a conditional access policy, use the following *New-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy commands*.

```
New-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy -DisplayName "MFA policy" -State "Enabled" -Conditions $conditions -GrantControls $controls 
```

## Create a request

To create the *New-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy* request

## Create the request body

The following common definitions are used to build a request body:

|Name  |Required  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|DisplayName     |   true      |   String      |  Policy name       |
|State     |  true       |String         |   Policy state      |
|Conditions     |   true      | [Condition Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccessconditionset?view=graph-rest-beta)        |  Represents the type of conditions that govern when the policy applies       |
|GrantControls     |  true       |  [Grant Controls Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccessgrantcontrols?view=graph-rest-beta)       |    Represents grant controls that must be fulfilled to pass the policy     |

## Example request body

The following template is used to create a conditional access policy with display name "CA002: Require MFA for medium + sign-in risk".

```
$conditions = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessConditionSet
$conditions.Applications = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessApplicationCondition
$conditions.Applications.IncludeApplications = "All"
$conditions.Users = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessUserCondition
$conditions.Users.IncludeGroups = "6c96716b-b32b-40b8-9009-49748bb6fcd5"
$conditions.Users.ExcludeGroups = "f753047e-de31-4c74-a6fb-c38589047723"
$conditions.SignInRiskLevels = @('high', 'medium')
$controls = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.ConditionalAccessGrantControls
$controls._Operator = "OR"
$controls.BuiltInControls = "mfa"
```

To create the policy using the above template for conditions and control use the below command 

```
New-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy -DisplayName "CA0002: Require MFA for medium + sign-in risk" -State "enabledForReportingButNotEnforced" -Conditions $conditions -GrantControls $controls
```

        "termsOfUse": []
    }
}
```

# Step 6: Update a Conditional Access Policy 

Let us now update the conditional access policy we retrieved in the previous step.

To update a conditional access policy, use the following *PATCH* operation.

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identity/conditionalAccess/policies/{policyid}
```
The PATCH URI has `{policyid}` parameter. In this example, `{policyid}` is "34ab2fe6-51ec-4442-9558-723f480ee29f".  

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identity/conditionalAccess/policies/34ab2fe6-51ec-4442-9558-723f480ee29f
```

## Create a request

To create the *PATCH* request

The following headers are required:

| Request header   | Description |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Content-Type:*  | Required. Set to `application/json`. |
| *Authorization:* | Required. Set to a valid `Bearer` [access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/#authorization-code-grant-interactive-clients). |

For more information about how to create the request, see [Components of API request/response](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/#components-of-a-rest-api-requestresponse).

## Create the request body

The following common definitions are used to build a request body:

|Name  |Required  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|displayName     |   true      |   String      |  Policy name       |
|state     |  true       |String         |   Policy state      |
|conditions     |   true      | [Condition Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccessconditionset?view=graph-rest-beta)        |  Represents the type of conditions that govern when the policy applies       |
|grantControls     |  true       |  [Grant Controls Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccessgrantcontrols?view=graph-rest-beta)       |    Represents grant controls that must be fulfilled to pass the policy     |

## Example request body

The following example body is used to update the conditional access policy with an additional group id {"ba8e7ded-8b0f-4836-ba06-8ff1ecc5c8ba"}.

```json
{ 
    "conditions": { 
        "users": { 
            "includeGroups": [ 
                "6c96716b-b32b-40b8-9009-49748bb6fcd5", "ba8e7ded-8b0f-4836-ba06-8ff1ecc5c8ba"
            ]
        } 
    }
} 
```

## Responses

A successful response for the operation to create a conditional access policy:

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|

        "termsOfUse": []
    }
}
```

# Step 7: Delete a specific conditional access policy

To delete a specific conditional access policy, use the following *DELETE* operation

```http
DELETE https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identity/conditionalAccess/policies/{policyid}
```

The DELETE URI has `{policyid}` parameter. In this example, `{policyid}` is "34ab2fe6-51ec-4442-9558-723f480ee29f".  As all the required parameters are given in the URI, there is no need for a separate request body.

```http
DELETE https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identity/conditionalAccess/policies/34ab2fe6-51ec-4442-9558-723f480ee29f
```

#### Responses

The successful response for the 'DELETE' operation is shown below:

|Name  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|204 No Content    | Deleted        |

##### Example response

Once the 'DELETE' request is submitted, a 204 (successful) response is returned.
